ðŸ”° Location Tracker for University Transportation System
â€¢ An IOT based project for tracking the bus with hardware and software.
â€¢ Hardware: NodeMcu/Esp8266 version 3, Neo6m gps module version 2, wires.
â€¢ Software: Arduino Ide and C++ for uploading the code into NodeMcu, Android Studio and java
for making the mobile application.
â€¢ By Gps module we receive the data from satelites and by NodeMcu we send the data to our
database(Firebase) and by mobile application we can see the location of a specific Bus inserting
the specific Bus id.
