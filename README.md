## A Simple Overview

* ðŸ’ An IOT based project for tracking the bus with hardware and software.

* ðŸ’ Hardware: NodeMcu/Esp8266 version 3, Neo6m gps module version 2, wires.

* ðŸ’ Software: Arduino Ide and C++ for uploading the code into NodeMcu, Android Studio and java for making the mobile application.

* ðŸ’ By Gps module we receive the data from satellites and by NodeMcu we send the data to our database (Firebase), and by the mobile application, we can see the location of a specific Bus by inserting the specific Bus id.
