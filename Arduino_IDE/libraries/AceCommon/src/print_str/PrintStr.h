/**
 * Base class for all template instances of the PrintStr<SIZE> class. A
 * common base class reduces the code size because only one copy of the core
 * code is included across all possible template instances. Otherwise,
 * PrintStr<10> is a different class than PrintStr<20> and would pull in
 * duplicate copies of the code.
 *
 * Usually the `Print` base class can be used to accept instances of the
 * `PrintStr<SIZE>` objects. However, if you need access to the `length()`
 * method, then you need to use the `PrintStrBase` class instead, since the
 * `Print` class does not have a `length()` method.
 *
 * Here are the actual numbers. I modified tests/CommonTest.ino program to use
 * 2 template instances, PrintStr<10> and PrintStr<20> instead of just
 * PrintStr<10>. Without this base class optimization, the sketch uses:
 *
 *    * 10030 bytes (32%) of program storage space,
 *    * 710 bytes (34%) of dynamic memory on an Arduino Nano.
 *
 * After inserting this PrintStrBase class in the class hierarchy, the same
 * sketch uses:
 *
 *    * 9936 bytes (32%) of program storage space,
 *    * 698 bytes (34%) of dynamic memory,
 *
 * So we save 94 bytes of flash memory, and 12 bytes of static RAM. And even
 * better, the program and RAM size was the same as using 2 PrintStr<10>
 * instances. In other words, the amount of flash and static RAM remains
 * constant no matter how many template instances we create.

     * the `flush()` method as non-virtual methods. So I was forced to avoid
     * marking this implementation with the `override` keyword, which
     * unfortunately triggered warning messages when compiled with clang++
     * compiler on Linux or MacOS using the EpoxyDuino environment.
     *
     * The STM32 platform fixed this in v2.0.0 on 2021-04-21, and the ESP32
     * platform fixed this in v2.0.3 on 2022-05-04. I think we can finally
     * assume that most platforms implement a virtual flush() and apply the
     * `override` keyword here, which also fixes the compiler warnings in
     * EpoxyDuino. Unfortunately, it seems that we must still make an exception
     * for ESP32 on PLATFORMIO which seems to be stuck using a version of the
     * ESP32 core before v2.0.3.
     *
     * The only platform that is officially supported by AceCommon where the
     * `override` will cause problems is the
     * https://github.com/SpenceKonde/ATTinyCore platform whose `Print` class
     * does not implement `flush()` at all. I have to make an exception for that
     * Core, but there does not seem to be a single macro symbol that identifies
     * the ATTinyCore. I have to enumerate each microcontroller type supported
     * by that Core. Other platforms which also implement a non-virtual flush()
     * can be listed in the exception list.

/**
 * An implementation of `Print` that writes to an in-memory buffer supporting
 * strings less than 65535 in length. It is intended to be an alternative to
 * the `String` class to help avoid heap fragmentation due to repeated creation
 * and deletion of small String objects. The 'PrintStr' object inherit the
 * methods from the 'Print' interface which can be used to build an internal
 * string representation of various objects. Instead of using the
 * `operator+=()` or the `concat()` method, use the `print()`, `println()` (or
 * sometimes the `printf()` method) of the `Print` class. After the internal
 * string is built, the NUL-terminated c-string representation can be retrieved
 * using `cstr()`.
 *
 * This object is expected to be created on the stack instead of the heap
 * to avoid heap fragmentation. The `SIZE` parameter is a compile time constant,
 * to allow the internal string buffer to be created on the stack. The object
 * will be destroyed automatically when the stack is unwound after returning
 * from the function where this is used.
 *
 * An instance of `PrintStr` can be reused by calling the `flush()` method
 * which causes the internal buffer to be cleared to an empty string. An
 * instance of this object could be created statically and reused across
 * different calling sites, but this was not the main intended use of this
 * class.
 *
 * Warning: The contents of `cstr()` are valid only as long as the
 * PrintStr object is alive. The pointer should never be passed to another
 * part of the program if the PrintStr object is destroyed before the
 * pointer is used.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * @verbatim
 * #include <PrintStr.h>
 *
 * using namespace print_str;
 *
 * void fillStringA(PrintStr& message) {
 *   message.print("hello, ");
 *   message.println("world!");
 * }
 *
 * void fillStringB(PrintStr& message) {
 *   message.print("There are ");
 *   message.print(42);
 *   message.println(" apples");
 * }
 *
 * void someFunction() {
 *   PrintStr<32> message;
 *   fillStringA(message)
 *   const char* cstr = message.cstr();
 *   // do stuff with cstr
 *
 *   message.flush();
 *   fillStringB(message);
 *   cstr = message.cstr();
 *   // do more stuff with cstr
 * }
 * @endverbatim
 *
 * @tparam SIZE size of internal string buffer including the NUL terminator
 *         character, the maximum is 65535, which means the maximum string
 *         length is 65534 characters.
